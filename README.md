# Data-Visualisation-of-Flight-delays-with-Tableau
Exploring Flights dataset and turning it into useful insights using Tableau

After looking at the data, I had a couple of questions in mind:
1. what causes flight delay? 
2. what are the reasons that lead to most cancellations ?
3. which state has the most flight cancellations? 
4. what time of the year cancellations happens the most?

After cleaning up the data using python and pandas on Jupyter notebook, I exported the .csv file of Dataset on Tableau and the journey of aggregating data started.

Iâ€™ve turned these questions into visualizations and then put together all these different visualizations together in a dashboard. Check them from here
